- DeepErase is a U-net-like tensorflow sementic segmenation model removing artifacts (lines, boxes, spurious words) from text images extracted from documents. The cleansing of the artifacts enhances OCR performance over the image extractions.

### Abstract
- We present a method to programmatically generate artiÔ¨Åcial text images with realistic-looking artifacts, and use them to train the U-net-like model in a totally unsupervised manner.
- The U-net-like model was trained in two modes:
-- Standalone:
-- Joint with Recognition model:
